## Towards intelligent imaging: Role of applied AI and generative models

The goal of this post is to develop broad range of necessary AI-technologies to develop new data acqusition and reconstructions which not only allow efficient/fast data acquisitions but also synthesis of novel contrasts to allow more "effective diagnosis" followed with automatic image intereption in an end-to-end setting, a marked differently and radical approach.  This would require moving away from the traditional approaches and representation by adopting a more generic embedded-space representation, a following road map outlines the development statergy. 

 ## Road map

1. Develop good representation underlying objects aka. structures of organs to embedding's via employing computer vision algorithms to develop embeddingsÂ 

2. Design novel contrast from the learned representations for effective diagnosis learning for complex probability distributions via attention modelling or baysien modelling 

3. Combine multi-modal data with ultimate goal of better risk stratification along with other datasets (e.g. radiology report read via NLP) via automated intepretation
